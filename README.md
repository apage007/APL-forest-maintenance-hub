# APL-forest-maintenance-hub (this may be divided between simple spread sheets and a local database - possibly collected through an APL project mgt routine)
This is expected to become a repository for Forest Maintenance Information and Administration.
Forest Maintenance requires many parts which have been disabled by the current private debt based currency creation system.
These parts include but are not limited to the following:
1) Locations of test areas - it is preferred that this be done in UTM coordinates on a specified Datum source.
2) Treatements performed - when, what was done, what was measured and when, a summary of results
3) Field replications of previous tests will result in new information - discussions will help decide what else needs to be done to solidify projections
4) Summary of expectations of particular treatments - 
See Common Good Dialogue for past discussions. Look for "A Plan for Appropriate Liquidity" there are many parts described in that paper.
It will be uploaded here at some point.
5) Available equipment and operators for particular actiivty
6) Funding system current in area of interest - who to contact, what to expect
7) County Study areas
8) Private study areas
